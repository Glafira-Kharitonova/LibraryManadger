# LibraryManadger
Library manager written in Java.

Two implementations - for working in the console(LibraryManadger.java) and a manager with a graphical interface(LibraryManadgerGUI.java).

There are also three files for testing - a file with books(books.txt), and a separate file with Russian(russian_books.txt) and foreign(foreign_books.txt) literature
